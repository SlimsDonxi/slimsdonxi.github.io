The Bear and the Bee
Everybody knows that bears love honey
One day, Mr Bear looks in his cupboard.
And he can't find any honey.
Oh no!
No honey, he says
So he goes into the forest to find some.
He sees a beehive in a tree.
He smells the honey.
Humm, honey!
He sticks his paw into the beehive.
And
A bee flies out.
Hey bear, go away!
This is not your honey.
Mr bear is annoyed
I am bigger than you, he says.
And I am stronger than you too!
I can do what I want.
Now, buzz off!
Mr Bear sticks his paw into the beehive again.
And, zing!
The bee stings him right on his nose!
My nose, my nose!
I'm so angry!
Growls Mr bear
He finds a big stick.
He tries to hit the bee.
He swings, and he swings
But the bee is too fast.
Mr bear gets angrier and angrier.
I will squash you! Come here!
The bee flies back into the beehive.
Haha, now you're trapped.
He swings his stick at the beehive.
He smashes it to pieces.
Then he hears a strange sound.
It gets louder
and louder.
Thousands of bees fly out of the smashed beehive
They fly around Mr Bear's head.
They sting him on his ear.
They sting him on his elbow.
They chase Mr Bear through the forest.
They sting him on his arms.
His legs,
His hands,
and especially on his nose.
Mr Bear runs all the way home.
And slams the door shut.
Then he hears a voice behind him.
It's Mrs. Bear
You did it again, didn't you?
You lost your temper.
Yes, he says
As he counts his bee stings.
Here's the bee sting medicine.
Also, we have honey in the cupboard
It's behind the flour.
Moral, a hot temper will always get you into trouble.
