Alex's super medicine
I'm not feeling so good mom
Let's visit doctor Bongi, she can help
Drink this medicine Alex. 
It will make you better
But I don't like medicine, it's yucky
Jetty, I'll let you play with my shiny red car
if you drink my medicine
no way!
How can i make my medicine taste better?
I know, I'll put it on my sandwich.
Urgh!
‎
Maybe I should hide it away.
I know, I'll hide it in the garden.
Oh no!
‎
I'd better try something else.
I know, I'll hide it in a bird's nest.
Aah!
‎
Humm. maybe i should just try it?
‎
Wooah, this is actually so much fun!
I feel something.. What's happening?
I feel so much better! 
And all i had to do was drink my medicine.
You did it Alex! We're so proud of you.
