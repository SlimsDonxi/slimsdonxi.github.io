Grow flower GROW!
One day Fran found a flowerpot filled with soil.
Poking out from the top was a tiny green tip.
"I will grow this flower", Fran said to fred.
She took it home.
"Grow flower", she said.
But the tip stayed tiny.
"I think this flower is hungry", Fran said.
So Fran went to the fridge.
Inside she found some of her favorite food.
She gave the flower a slice of pizza.
The next day Fran gave it a piece of cheeseburger.
Then she gave it spaghetti, two chocolate chip cookies,
and a large spoonful of strawberry ice cream.
She even gave it one of Fred's juicy bones.
But the flower didn't grow. The tip stayed tiny.
Fran got fed up.
"Silly flower!" Frand said.
And she threw it out the back door.
The flowerpot fell on the ground and rolled away
The rain fell on it.
The sun shone on it.
Finally, the tiny green tip grew..
And grew
and grew.
Until one day Fran and Fren went outside to play.
When they opened the door, a surprise was waiting.
A big beautiful flower, just for Fran!
